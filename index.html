        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm shoutvoid, a self-taught amateur computer technician looking to become a cybersecurity pro and build a career I can enjoy and be proud of. As a beginner, I offer curiosity and a sincere desire to learn and improve myself.</p>
        <p>I've been hooked these days on KC7 Cyber, an online cyber detective game that has players investigate realistic cyberattack cases as a security analyst using KQL (Kusto Query Language) and ADX (Azure Data Explorer). I've even written a few walkthroughs about it ;-)</p>
        <p>I also participated in this year's picoCTF, which also has a write-up on this very site.</p>

        <h2>About this website</h2>
        <p>This website doubles as a personal project to learn about HTML5 and CSS3, while hopefully avoiding as much JavaScript as possible ;-)</p>
        <p>It's made from scratch using vanilla HTML and CSS, with (so far!) not a hint of JavaScript for any of its form or function. As such, it's a static website: there are no ads, trackers, cookies (first-party or otherwise), first- or third-party JS, or other disruptive elements that have unfortunately become all-too-common across the web.</p>
        <p>This page is currently hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, and I'm considering a mirror on <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>. Feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/ShoutVoid/ShoutVoid.github.io">its repository</a>.</p>
        <p>And, as usual: all views expressed on this website only reflect mine, nobody else's (not employers, friends, acquitances, associates, etc.) and any mentions of people, places, products, brands, organizations, etc. are <strong>NOT</strong> endorsed by said persons, places, products, brands, organizations, etc. <strong>Any exceptions would be explicitly noted</strong>.</p>
